# Generic Cogs

This project is a collection of generic extensions/cogs that can be used with discord.py.

**All files were developed with Python 3.11.1 and tested with discord.py version 2.1.0.**

**All licenses are contained within the individual files. If no license is present, you may assume it's MIT licensed.**

In general, these files follow the same basic template. If they require a database, they are configured to use `asqlite`, and may use differently named files for each specific function. This behavior could be changed by you.

Converting the commands contained within to slash commands should be a trivial task.
